    <img src="C:\Users\abjsi\Downloads\gamers.png" height="200"width ="300" style="float:right" alt="Gaming"/>
    <p>Game technology is developing so rapidly that it will reach over 300 billion by 2026. We can expect game platforms to continue developing in 2019 onwards with billions of dollars in profit and over 2.5 billion gamers around the world. Besides the consistent and impressive growth of the industry, it is interesting to note that there has been a shift in revenue sources in the gaming space lately. The gaming industry used to make most of its money by selling games but today its revenue is coming from a different perspective.
